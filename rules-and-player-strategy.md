### Rules and Player Strategies
##### including ones under consideration

Basics:
* A player's objective is to fill as much as possible of their circle and square boards using puzzle pieces 
    * Circle pieces can only be used to fill the Circle board, same with Square pieces and board
    * Pieces on the same board are layered on top of ech other
    * Exception: If _two_ pieces add up to 4 quarters or less (but not more)
    they can be in the same layer and their coverage is combined
    * If two (non-whole) pieces that are in adjacent layers add up to more than 4 quarters 
    then the piece below can be used to fill in the gaps
    i.e. if a 3/4 piece is above a 1/2 piece, then the board is fully covered 

* When losing a puzzle piece a player,
    * Can (should) give up a piece they possess but that is not currently in play 
    * If they don't posses out-of-play pieces, they must take a piece from the top layer of a board 
    (if two pieces are on same layer they can choose between them)
    * Should pick the piece that maximizes remaining combined board coverage
    * Should pick the smallest piece if the difference between choices doesn't result in different board coverage

* When gaining a puzzle piece a player,
    * Can choose not to put the piece back in play, 
    i.e. just on the side and not on one of their boards, 
    if it doesn't increase coverage on either of their boards
    * If putting the puzzle piece back in play, 
    must put the piece on the top of the board that the piece belongs to
  
* Both board sections are weighted equally (Circle is Full and Square is Half is same as Circle is Half and Square is Full)

Variations under consideration:
* Different weights
    * Different weights between the boards, i.e. Circle worth more than Square or vice-versa
    * Within the same, game different players are assigned different weights for their two boards

* Different "layering" options
    * Certain puzzle pieces allow any piece in the layer below to be given up 
    * Certain puzzle pieces allow certain other pieces in the layer below to be given up
    * 1/2 or 1/4 pieces must be placed on top each other (re: not in the same layer)
    * The above, but a 1/2 and 1/4 piece can still be placed in the same layer 

* "Super Pieces" 
    * Super pieces have circle AND square components 
    * Not always full ones?

* Considering other players when deciding which puzzle pieces to lose 
    * Player (should) consider what piece has least value for other player 
    when deciding which piece to give up (at least as tie-breaker) 

    * Player can have adversarial or collaborative strategy toward other players
    * Player could even decide to give up slightly more value 
    in exchange for greatly reducing amount of value given to (adversarial) opponent
