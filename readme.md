#### WTF is *Cover Your Board*?

I was trying to select a game/activity I could use for exploration with ML-based strategy algorithms. 
I don't really want to do chess or poker, because everyone does chess or poker, 
and I have really strong non-conformists streak.
Also, I want something where I could add complexity to the game incrementally. 
While that's possible for poker it's much harder to do with chess.

I remembered a game I played a few times with some (Eastern European) kids in college. 
I don't remember the name of the game or really anything about its origins. 
I _think_ it could have been a kids game, but this being college it was played as a drinking game.
Because it's been over a quarter-century since I've played the game, and I did I mention we were drinking,
my memory of the rules is somewhat fuzzy. 
We may not even played with consistent rules each time. 
For all I know they were just making the rules up as they went.
It must been based on _something_ given there were fabricated puzzle pieces and boards, 
which seems like a long way to go for a college drinking game.

I decided I was going to use the _game_ for a number of reasons...
* It has fair amount of complexity with elements of luck as well as strategy
* There are probably a good number of rules variations that could be added incrementally
* I don't have to worry about getting the rules wrong because I know I'm wrong from the start

Since I can't remember the name and I don't want to spend a whole lot fixating on finding the _right_ name,
I'm just going to go with __Cover Your Board__.

The basics of the game are as follows...
* Each player has a board with two sections, one being a cut-out circle and the other a cut-out square
* There are "puzzle pieces" which are a quarter, half, three-quarter, and whole circle (or square)
* At the beginning of the game everyone had enough pieces to cover both sections and then some(1)
* On each players turn, the player(2)... 
    * gave one of their pieces to another player
    * removed a piece from play
    * received a pass
* The goal was to have as much of each section covered, 
as the more that was uncovered the more you had to drink
* The game proceeded until only one player had puzzle pieces remaining     
    
(1) I don't remember how it was determined which pieces each player started with.
I will definitely make that one of the variants included in the game.    

(2) Although I know it involved dice, 
I don't remember specifically how it was determined which of the above actions were taken. 
I'm just going to model it on the Left/Center/Right dice game because it seems _close enough._
For all I know, it was modeled off LCR, but if it was it didn't occur to me at the time.
